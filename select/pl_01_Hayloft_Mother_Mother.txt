You better run
My daddy's got a gun

My daddy's got a gun
Ga-ga-ga-ga-ga
It started with
the hayloft a-creakin'
Well it just started
in the hay (loft)
With his longjohns on
pop went a-creeping
Out to the barn up to the hay
Young lovers
and they are not sleeping
Young lovers in the hay (loft)
With his gun turned on
pop went a-creeping
Out to the barn
up to the hay (loft)
My daddy's got a gun
My daddy's got a gun
My daddy's got a gun
You better run
My daddy's got a gun
My daddy's got a gun

It started with
the hayloft a-creakin'
Well it just started in the hay
With his longjohns on
Pop went a-creeping
Out to the barn
up to the hay (loft)
Young lovers with their legs
tied up in knots
Young lovers with their legs
tied up in knots
With his long tall gun
Pop went a-creeping
To blow their hay-loft
dead heads straight off
My daddy's got a gun

You better run
